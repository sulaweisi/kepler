# Kepler

Kepler is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such.
Follows the MimbleWimble protocol, which provides great anonymity and scaling characteristics.
Proof of work: Cuckatoo (C31).
Relatively fast block time: one minute.
Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.
Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.
Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.

## Specs

Ticker: KMW
Max Kepler Supply: 2.138.639.000
Premine: 2%
Avg 60s /block
Confidential assets
Block rewards: 1000 KMW / block
C31 only
Halving every two years

## Getting Started

To learn more about the technology, read our introduction.

To build and try out Kepler, see the build docs.

## Philosophy

Kepler believes in keeping it simple. Users will feel welcomed by Kepler's cool appeal. Kepler will redefine how apps using the MW protocol are seen, ease of use comes to mind.

We believe in pull requests, data and scientific research. We do not believe in unfounded beliefs.
